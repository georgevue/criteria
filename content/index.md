## Clincal Areas Covered

CMS has designated eight priority clinical areas, based on the
significance and the high prevalence of certain
diseases in the Medicare population.  

Our goal is to provide the most relevant criteria for these clinical areas


* Coronary artery disease (suspected or diagnosed)
* Suspected pulmonary embolism
* Headache (traumatic and non-traumatic)
* Hip pain
* Low back pain
* Shoulder pain (to include suspected rotator cuff injury)
* Cancer of the lung (primary or metastatic, suspected or diagnosed)
* Cervical or neck pain

## Version Control

Each criteria will be stored in a public repository using version control.
Proposed updates will be requested, and acceptance will be based on subcommittee
approval.

    Proposed update -> Subcommitte Review -> Public Repository Updated
